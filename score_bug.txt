# Score Bug Component Unification - Goal & Challenges

## Goal
Use the EXACT same React component for game displays in both:
1. Main Games tab (GamesView.jsx) 
2. Player modal (TeamDetailView.jsx)

Currently they show different formats:
- Games tab: "Team vs Opponent" with colored dots ✅ (preferred format)
- Modal: "Team @ Opponent" without dots ❌ (inconsistent)

## Technical Challenge
The two components expect different data structures:

**GamesView GameResult expects:**
```javascript
team = {
  name: "USC",
  game: {
    opponent: "Arizona", 
    score: "10-23",
    status: "completed"
  }
}
```

**TeamDetailView expects:**
```javascript
team = { name: "USC" }
gameData = {
  opponent: "Arizona",
  score: "10-23", 
  status: "completed"
}
```

## User Requirements
1. Both views must show IDENTICAL format (team dots, "vs", opponent dots)
2. Must be literally the same component (not just similar logic)
3. Modal should dismiss when clicking outside
4. Show game dates instead of just "Scheduled" for upcoming games

## Previous Failed Attempts
- Created new shared component (user rejected - not the same component)
- Tried to export/import GameResult but data structure mismatch causes issues
- Need to either normalize data structures OR make GameResult flexible enough to handle both

## Next Steps
1. Export GameResult component from GamesView
2. Modify TeamDetailView to structure data exactly as GameResult expects
3. Ensure both views render identically
4. Test that changes to GameResult affect both views simultaneously
